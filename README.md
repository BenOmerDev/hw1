Tic Tac Toe AI is a project I've been working on in order to learn the workings or AI code. I will be writing a small neural network intended to learn to play tic tac toe against humnans through reinforcement learning.

This website would house an embedded tic tac toe game where humans can play against and train the Tic Tac Toe AI. The initial site includes only Home, About, and Merchandise pages without much content. But ideally there would be interactive ways to see the progress of the AI and to engage in learning and friendly competition.
